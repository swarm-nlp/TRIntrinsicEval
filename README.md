## Models

### FastText
FastText is a word embedding model widely used in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Developed by Facebook, this model provides better results than other word embedding models, especially in representing small and rare words. The FastText model uses the character sequence and subwords of a word to represent it. This way, it can better capture the semantic structure of the word. For example, the word "curious" is broken down into the subwords "curi" and "ous", and the vectors of these subwords contribute to the vector of the word. The FastText model uses either the "Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)" or "Skip-gram" algorithms for word embedding. CBOW is based on predicting a word from the context of other words, while Skip-gram is used to predict other words in the given context. When used for word embedding, the FastText model shows high performance in NLP tasks such as word similarity, word classification, sentiment analysis, and tagging. Additionally, the FastText model is also used for developing low-resource language models in NLP. FastText is an open-source software, and there is a Python library developed by Facebook for using the FastText model. As a result, researchers and developers can easily use and apply the FastText model in their NLP applications.

### Word2Vec
Word2vec is a word embedding model widely used in the field of natural language processing (NLP). This model represents a word according to its coordinates in vector space, allowing for mathematical expression of similarities and differences in word meanings. The Word2vec model works with two different algorithms: Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram. CBOW is based on predicting a word from other words in a given context, while Skip-gram is used to predict other words in a given context from a word. These algorithms are trained using a large text corpus, and a vector is created for each word. The Word2vec model performs well in NLP tasks such as word similarity, word classification, sentiment analysis, and tagging. Additionally, this model requires less processing power compared to calculating high-dimensional features by using low-dimensional vector representations. The Word2vec model is open-source software and can be used in many programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++.

### Glove
The GloVe (Global Vectors) model is a machine learning algorithm used in the field of natural language processing (NLP). GloVe is one of the most commonly used word embedding methods, which is used to represent words as numerical vectors. Words differ in their coordinate positions in vector space. In this way, word vectors allow mathematical expression of similarities and differences in word meanings. The GloVe model uses co-occurrence statistics between words to learn word vectors. The model calculates the word co-occurrence matrix from a large text corpus and discovers patterns in this matrix. Then, it creates a vector for each word using these patterns. The GloVe model performs well in NLP tasks such as word similarity, word relationships, and word meanings. In particular, the GloVe model is highly effective for NLP applications that require finding word similarity or relationships. The GloVe model was developed at Stanford University and is available as open-source code. Therefore, researchers and developers can easily use and apply the GloVe model in natural language processing applications.
